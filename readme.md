## Introduction

Welcome to the **Github Code Extractor**! This web application allows you to scrape and display the folder structure and code of any public GitHub repository. Simply input the repository URL, select the file types and options youâ€™re interested in, and hit "Go". The extracted code can then be copied to your clipboard with a single click, ready to be smacked into an LLM or used as needed.

## Features

- **GitHub Repository Scraper**: Extract folder structures and code from public GitHub repositories.
- **File Type Filtering**: Select specific file types you want to include in the extraction.
- **AI Prompt**: Optionally add a custom AI prompt to the output for seamless integration with LLMs.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy the extracted code with a humorous prompt to "smack that shit into an LLM".
- **GitHub Themed UI**: A user interface that subtly mirrors the GitHub theme for a familiar experience.
